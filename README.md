# Enhancing-Email-Security

## Objective
Email security is essential for protecting sensitive information, preventing cyber attacks, and ensuring safe communication. The evolution of email and the increasing sophistication of threats have necessitated the development of comprehensive security measures. By understanding the common email security threats and implementing key protective measures, individuals and organizations can safeguard their email communications and maintain the integrity of their information. The primary objectives of email security are to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of email communications, while also meeting compliance and regulatory requirements, protecting users from threats, and maintaining business continuity

5. Ensure email integrity to prevent tampering
 

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

1. SPF (Sender Policy Framework)
2. DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)
3. DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance)
4. PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) encryption
5. S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) encryption

## Steps
Staring out in cybersecurity as SOC Analyst â€” intern in an MSSP, I investigated a suspicious email that slipped past our filters. I was tasked to dig into the email headers, and that was where I encountered SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.

I was way lost at the first glance, but as I learned more about email and it architecture, I discovered how technology can elegantly simplify complex concepts, making them appear deceptively straightforward. This is what sparked my interest in email security.

**In this series we will;**
- Delve into the fundamentals of email, explaining what it is, how it functions, and the key components that make up the email infrastructure
- Also explore the key aspects of email security.
  
*Email, short for electronic mail, has become an indispensable communication tool in both personal and professional spheres. Despite its ubiquitous nature, many people may not fully understand how email works behind the scenes.*

**What is An Email?**
Email is a method of exchanging digital messages over the internet using electronic devices. It allows users to send and receive text messages, documents, images, and other files quickly and efficiently. The primary components of an email include the sender, recipient, subject, body, and attachments. Emails are transmitted between email servers using standardized protocols to ensure reliable delivery.

**A Look At History and Evolution of Email**
The concept of email dates back to the early days of computer networks in the 1960s and 1970s. Ray Tomlinson is often credited with inventing email in 1971 when he used the @ symbol to separate the user name from the computer name in an email address. This innovation laid the foundation for modern email systems.
